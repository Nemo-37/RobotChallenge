/* This example shows how to get single-shot range
 measurements from the VL53L0X. The sensor can optionally be
 configured with different ranging profiles, as described in
 the VL53L0X API user manual, to get better performance for
 a certain application. This code is based on the four
 "SingleRanging" examples in the VL53L0X API.

 The range readings are in units of mm. */

// Uncomment this line to use long range mode. This
// increases the sensitivity of the sensor and extends its
// potential range, but increases the likelihood of getting
// an inaccurate reading because of reflections from objects
// other than the intended target. It works best in dark
// conditions.

// Uncomment ONE of these two lines to get
// - higher speed at the cost of lower accuracy OR
// - higher accuracy at the cost of lower speed

//#define HIGH_SPEED
