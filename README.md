Finally, MiniSumo robots can be interesting not only for competitors, but also for spectators. The competition offers an exciting and spectacular spectacle where robots fight for victory in the ring. It can be inspiring and stimulating for people, especially young people who are interested in science, technology and robotics.
Overall, MiniSumo robots provide a fun and educational platform that promotes skill development, competition, and innovation in the field of robotics. They offer participants the opportunity to bring their ideas to life and enjoy the process of creating and operating autonomous robots.

To assemble the best mini sumo robot you will need the following steps:
1 Learning the Rules: The first step is to learn the rules and requirements for the MiniSumo competition. The rules define the dimensions, weight and restrictions for the robot, as well as the rules for fighting in the ring. Make sure your robot meets competition requirements.

2 Platform and Component Selection: Decide which platform and components you will use for your mini sumo robot. It can be a DIY platform, a ready-made kit, or your own creative solution. Choose the motors, controllers, sensors and other components that suit your needs and budget.

3 Design and build: Start by designing and building your robot. Design its shape, suspension, and mechanical systems considering its stability and agility in the ring. Assemble and test all robot components to make sure they function properly.

4 Sensors and Enemy Detection: An important part of the mini sumo robot is its ability to detect the enemy and make decisions based on the information received. Place appropriate sensors such as infrared, ultrasonic, or line sensors so that the robot can detect and respond to enemy movement.

5 Programming and Algorithms: Develop software and control algorithms for your robot. Determine attack and defense strategies, as well as reactions to enemy movements. Customize your robot for maximum efficiency and accuracy during battles.

6 Testing and improvement: After assembling and programming your mini sumo robot, conduct a series of tests in the ring or in conditions as close as possible to the competition. Use the test results to identify weaknesses and improve the robot. Make any necessary adjustments to the design, mechanics, or software.

7 Competitive Participation: After reaching the desired level of functionality and performance, your robot is ready to compete in MiniSumo competitions. Take on the challenge and gain experience by analyzing the results and strategies of other participants.
It is important to remember that assembling the best mini sumo robot takes time, patience and creativity. Experiment, learn from your mistakes and strive for continuous improvement

 # Micromouse

Micromouse is a competitive robot designed to compete in autonomous maze-solving competitions. The robot must independently find its way from the starting point to the goal, avoiding obstacles and dead ends.

Here are some basic aspects that I know about Micromouse robots:

- History: The concept of Micromouse robots originated in the 1970s. The first Micromouse competition took place in Japan in 1979, and it became a popular event among students and robotics enthusiasts.

- Goal: The goal of Micromouse's main stream is to create a robot that can navigate complex mazes, avoiding obstacles and avoiding dead ends. The robot must find the path as quickly as possible.

- Autonomy: Micromouse robots operate completely autonomously. This means that they must be able to make decisions based on sensor inputs and adjust accordingly without human intervention at the first moment in time.

- Technical aspects: Micro mouse robots are usually equipped with various sensors such as infrared distance sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, etc. They use this data to measure position in the maze and make movement decisions.

- Algorithms and Programming: To achieve optimal results in Micromouse competitions, robots must be programmed using complex path finding and motion control algorithms. The art is to find a balance between speed and efficiency in choosing a path.

- Competitions: Micromouse competitions are held at various levels, from school events to international evenings. They involve teams of students and engineers demonstrating their skills in robotics and programming.

- Mazes: Mazes used in competitions can have different structures and sizes. Some mazes can be very confusing and maintain different patterns.

- Development: The Micromouse competition aims to develop skills in robotics, programming, engineering and algorithmic thinking among students and enthusiasts. They also facilitate the exchange of experiences and ideas between participants.
